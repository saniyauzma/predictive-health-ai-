## ðŸ§  Abstract

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized healthcare by enabling predictive modeling for early disease detection and risk assessment. This research develops AI-driven models to analyze clinical, genomic, and lifestyle data for diseases like heart conditions, diabetes, asthma, PCOS, and sleep disorders. Using ensemble machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost), the models show high accuracy and interpretability.

Explainable AI tools (LIME, SHAP) ensure transparency, aiding clinical adoption. With comprehensive preprocessing and tuning, this work demonstrates the power of AI in proactive, data-informed healthcare.
